# Intelligent_Tractor

The project is being developed by a team of four people and covers topics related to artificial intelligence. It involves implementing a two-dimensional, discrete environment for an autonomous agent using the state space search strategy technique (BFS) to solve the problem of motion planning for the agent in the environment.


Work is still in progress. Soon algotihm A* will be added to improve code performances.
